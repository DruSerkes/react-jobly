[Live App Demo](https://serkules-jobly.netlify.app)

## Getting started 
1. clone this repo
2. npm install
2. npm start

### That's it! 
I hardcoded the API calls to a [previously deployed Node/Express backend](https://github.com/DruSerkes/Jobly) with sample data, so once you register/login, you should be able to navigate all of the mock companies and jobs. 

## Features
* Users can register/login
* Users can view a list of jobs or companies
* Users can search for jobs or companies
* Users can view/edit their profile information
* Users can apply for jobs with the click of a button 

## Technology 
* React
* Axios
* Formik
* Node/Express
* PostgreSQL
* JWT
